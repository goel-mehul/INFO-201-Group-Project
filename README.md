# INFO-201-Group-Project

Our topic for the project is homelessness present in USA. We are going to analyze different data sets to find trends between different types of homeless people and reasons why they suffer. We are then going to analyze how housing agencies have an impact on homelessness. Finally, we plan to provide people with graphs depicting the rise of homelessness and the reasons for it. We hope this data would be a wake up call for the government agencies to bring future policies to counter this increase in homelessness.
